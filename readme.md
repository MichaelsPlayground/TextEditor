# Android Text Editor

Last time I tried to save a simple text file on my Android device and found that there is no application 
installed that allows to write or read a text file.

This app is a **Text Editor** that has a limited functionality:
1) load a file from the external storage
2) save a text file to the external storage
3) copy the file content to the clipboard
4) paste the clipboard's content to the file

As this app uses the device's internal file picker there is no need to grant any permissions for reading and 
writing.

On my real device an existing file doe not get overwritten, but a new file is created with (1) at the end.

This code is **Public DOmain** - have fun with the app.
